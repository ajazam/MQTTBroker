# MQTTBroker

This is my attempt at writing a MQTT 5 broker. The intention is to learn Rust and MQTT.

Please do not expect regular checkins as I will be working on this and other projects in my spare time.

I have used the Apache License so that if anybody finds the code useful they are free to use it.
